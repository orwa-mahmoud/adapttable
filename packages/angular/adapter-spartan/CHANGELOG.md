# @adapttable/spartan

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 5b8adbd: The table takes `stickyHeader` and `stickyTop` inputs. A sticky header stays in view inside a `maxHeight` box, in a table that scrolls sideways, or on the page below an app bar of `stickyTop` pixels, and pinned rows sit below it.

### Patch Changes

- a353b2d: Each grouping chip shows its level, as in "1. Team · 2. Status".

## 0.2.5

### Patch Changes

- 07b4440: Improve mobile cards with responsive field tiles, clearer identity and action sections, native kit surfaces, larger mobile action targets, and readable light and dark theme labels. Preserve automatic mobile cards and the explicit horizontal table option. Fix horizontal table scrolling in Reka UI and mobile action contrast in Taiga UI. Mobile selection, Save/Cancel and hierarchy controls also receive comfortable native touch surfaces. Restore visible loading placeholders and shared loading parts across Angular kits.

## 0.2.4

### Patch Changes

- 66aa1f8: Make descending sorting reachable from mobile cards with each kit's native direction button. Preserve the selected column, localized labels, keyboard activation and shared URL/Saved Views state.
  
  The Angular binding adds the protected `AdaptDataTableShell.sortDirection()` transition for native adapter templates.
- 9660922: Keep the saved-view name field readable on phones and wrap the native save button when the menu cannot fit both controls beside each other. Correct native right-anchored popovers for reserved scrollbar gutters in either text direction so the saved-views panel stays inside the viewport.

## 0.2.3

### Patch Changes

- c8d10ab: Align assistant headers, composers, conversation alignment and viewport placement with the Mantine reference while retaining each adapter's native controls. Correct native dialog offsets, mobile focus handoff and nested shortcuts dismissal.
- Updated dependencies [c8d10ab]
  - @adapttable/angular@0.5.2

## 0.2.2

### Patch Changes

- c9c36c3: Reset the Material add-group selector after a selection. Size Material grouping fields at the form-field boundary so their labels and native select arrows fit. Follow Material body typography tokens and distinguish column headers with the themed container surface. Give Spartan toolbars horizontal spacing and table text a readable line height.
- 62c9b3f: Keep editable Vue cell values as their accessible names, with editing instructions provided as descriptions. Reduce button chrome on Vue Unstyled, Element Plus, Reka UI and Nuxt UI cell activation controls, and align the native Vue search icon with its input.
  
  Give unlabeled mobile card values the full row width and clear heading emphasis in all eight Vue adapters.
  
  Restore visible keyboard focus on Angular editable cells without resetting the focus styles supplied by their native controls.
  
  Arrange Vue grouping and aggregation controls in compact, responsive rows with visible section labels, bounded selects, and borderless aggregation pickers. Preserve each kit's own controls and consumer class hooks. Give Element Plus column-menu icon buttons usable hit areas and keep Quasar resize handles visually light without reducing their drag targets.
  
  Keep Angular aggregation labels, operations and removal controls aligned, and add spacing and a visible grouping label across all nine adapters.
  
  Expose stable, visible grouping insertion targets during pointer drags and a clearly marked removal target in Vue and Angular adapters. Respect kit theme colors and highlight the current destination without shifting the chips. Restore native pointer dragging from Naive UI buttons, including grouping handles and sortable headers.
  
  Style active Vue filters as wrapping chips instead of browser-default lists, preserve native remove/clear controls, and provide phone-sized touch targets. Separate group labels from counts, and reduce the chrome on Naive UI sort and group-toggle buttons.
- 62c9b3f: Style active filters as wrapping inline chips using the adapter's actual public part names, removing list bullets and excess vertical space. Align pagination controls using the rendered footer and pager parts, with wrapping for narrow screens.

## 0.2.1

### Patch Changes

- 00df62b: Restore focus to the invoking toolbar button after Escape in Safari. Keep Spartan's native full-viewport popover hosts aligned with CDK coordinates across scrollbar gutters and viewport resizing. Constrain Taiga column menus on short viewports and use the native JavaScript positioner to avoid CSS anchor placement escaping the viewport in RTL.
- 2098049: Keep Angular selection, row-reorder and expand columns compact in wide tables and both reading directions. Preserve native control targets and give unused width to data columns instead of auxiliary controls.
  
  Give NG-ZORRO, CDK and Taiga UI column menus aligned rows, readable column names and native control targets.
  
  Keep Vuetify's filter trigger accessible name stable when its native menu adds an owned dialog to the accessibility tree.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- f7f62c6: Allow Angular column `headerActions` to render host templates or components,
  alongside plain text. All nine native kits pass the current header context and
  place the action outside the sortable caption. Export `AdaptHeaderActions` for
  custom adapter structure. Header actions appear in desktop headers; mobile cards
  keep their existing presentation.

### Patch Changes

- 7e33aa2: Organize the Angular 0.5 binding around canonical public entries: application
  hooks, column/rendering contracts, composition and `AdaptCellTemplate` at the
  root; headless factories/options under `/features`; structural Chrome, kit models,
  directives and controllers under `/adapter`. Specialized formula, pivot, router,
  sparkline and stream entries retain their declaration and DI-token identities.
  
  All nine native kits and Angular AI consume those entries; kit feature imports
  remain unchanged. Custom renderers/adapters must update binding imports using
  the migration guide. Each entry re-exports the public types its signatures return.
- 32e1255: Keep Angular native filter cards and toolbar menus within the viewport on phones
  and in RTL layouts. Material filters can flip above a low trigger, retain native
  placement on rendered-size changes and scrollbar gutters, and scroll their body
  while headers/actions remain visible. The optional `injectPopoverSpace`
  `allowAbove` getter preserves existing below-only defaults.
  
  Material Clear all labels fit a text button; resize handles keep their 48px
  native targets inside the header. Aria, CDK and Unstyled menus cap/flip within the
  viewport, and Taiga UI menus preserve readable name fields and a viewport gutter.
  NG-ZORRO, ngx-bootstrap and Taiga UI restore name-field focus after saving.
  Palettes handle Escape and Tab from command buttons; rename focus work retires
  with its owner. Spartan header filters follow live inherited writing direction.

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 143d5bf: Add the first public Spartan Angular table adapter with Brain control behavior,
  package-owned Helm styling, feature entries, scoped Tailwind tokens and adapter
  tests. Includes the upstream MIT notice and documented host peer requirements.

### Patch Changes

- 089d5d5: Share Angular table orchestration and desktop, mobile, filter, column-menu and group models through the binding. All nine adapters inherit the shared signals while retaining their native controls, templates, overlays, styling hooks and public table inputs and outputs. Export the shared model bases and view contracts for adapter authors, and preserve existing adapter type imports as re-exports.
- 0a9cb40: Keep native Angular filter cards beneath their triggers with readable fields,
  scrolling bodies and reachable dismissal. Correct native portal coordinates
  and RTL alignment, preserve each kit's controls and themes, and refine table
  toolbars and Material fields through the supported kit tokens. Export
  `injectPopoverSpace` so adapters share viewport measurement without sharing
  surfaces, positioning or controls.
  
  Keep Angular assistants in floating native windows with usable phone sheets,
  readable titles, growing composers and nonblocking tooltip overlays. Preserve
  native search groups and icons, drawer geometry, and accessible filter counts.
  
  Keep Unstyled and Aria text filter controls paired without relying on
  platform-specific native input widths.
- 8d1e749: Correct native control labels, separator and list-item semantics, and keyboard scroll-region metadata. Preserve established Angular binding names and signal access while removing alias declarations. Share live bulk-action coordination, consolidate CSS rules, and simplify re-exports and controller code without changing subscription snapshots or filter memo invalidation.
