## 1.1.2

### Patch Changes

- e909bf7: Refresh adapter npm README demos: animated GIFs (click through to mp4) replace static posters so npm package pages show motion without leaving the page.
- Updated dependencies [e909bf7]
  - @adapttable/core@1.1.2

## 1.1.1

### Patch Changes

- @adapttable/core@1.1.1

## 1.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 6c7030b: Bring the whole adapter set to feature parity.

  - **Entrance animation on every adapter.** The opt-in `animate` mount stagger —
    a dependency-free row/card entrance that honours `prefers-reduced-motion` —
    now works on MUI, Chakra, Ant Design, Radix, shadcn/ui and unstyled, not just
    Mantine. `useMountStagger` moved into `@adapttable/core`; the existing
    `@adapttable/mantine` import path is unchanged.
  - **Ant Design mobile-card windowing.** antd already virtualized desktop rows
    through its native table; under `virtualize` its mobile card list now windows
    through the shared engine as well, like every other adapter.
  - **Popover keyboard a11y fix (MUI, Chakra, Ant Design).** Pressing Escape in
    the filter popover now hands focus back to the Filters trigger instead of
    stranding keyboard users, matching the Mantine/Radix/unstyled behaviour and
    the documented overlay contract.
  - Docs and README polish: the `ColumnDef` `filter` JSDoc is attached to the
    right field, and each package README gains a "Try in StackBlitz" link (with
    migration guides where a source library exists); the Chakra README now
    correctly targets v3.

## 1.0.0

### Major Changes

- a94745e: AdaptTable 1.0 — the public API is now stable under semantic versioning.

  This release freezes the committed-stable surface: the `@adapttable/core` engine
  (source builders, `useDataTable` and its prop-getters, the core types, and the
  URL-state hooks), every adapter's `<DataTable>` props and extension points
  (`slots`, `classNames`, `toolbar`, `confirm`), and the `@adapttable/i18n` locale
  presets. From this release on, breaking changes to that surface ship only in a
  major version. There are no runtime behavior changes — this marks the stability
  commitment. `@adapttable/cli` is a scaffolding tool and keeps its own cadence.

## 0.3.3

### Patch Changes

- 761be36: Internal de-duplication: hoist the logic the Chakra and Radix adapters shared
  verbatim into `@adapttable/core` — the `<DataTable>` orchestration
  (`useDataTableShell`), the auto-filter range-widget logic, and the sticky
  cell-style / row-memo helpers. Each adapter now renders only its own kit's
  controls over the shared state. No behaviour, markup, or public-API change for
  consumers; core stays headless (zero UI-kit imports).
- Updated dependencies [761be36]
  - @adapttable/core@0.3.3

## 0.3.2

### Patch Changes

- 682d3b7: Road-to-1.0 prep: document the versioning & stability contract, mark the
  `mergeProps`/`Props` prop-getter plumbing as `@internal` (consumers use the
  `useDataTable` prop-getters, not the merge helper), add a `smoke-dist`
  post-build check that asserts every advertised `exports`/`main`/`module`/`types`
  target is actually emitted, and harden `getPath`/`humanizeKey` to tolerate an
  empty/undefined key so a transiently-malformed column key can never crash a
  render. No behaviour changes; no breaking changes.
- Updated dependencies [682d3b7]
  - @adapttable/core@0.3.2

## 0.3.1

### Patch Changes

- 6ab1391: docs: every package README now leads with a click-to-play demo — a poster (with
  a play button) that links to an mp4 of the table in action — replacing the
  autoplaying GIF. Republishing so the new READMEs land on npm.
- Updated dependencies [6ab1391]
  - @adapttable/core@0.3.1

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- a90a2c2: Logical column pinning, so pinning stays correct under RTL.

  **Breaking.** Pinned-side values are now `"start"` / `"end"` (were `"left"` /
  `"right"`) — this is the public `pinned` layout value and the `colPin` URL token
  (e.g. `colPin=name:start`); pre-existing `left`/`right` URLs no longer parse. The
  label keys `pinLeft` / `pinRight` / `moveLeft` / `moveRight` are renamed to
  `pinStart` / `pinEnd` / `moveStart` / `moveEnd`, with logical display strings
  shipped for every locale. Pinning a data column is now a start-only toggle; the
  injected actions column keeps its one-click end-pin.

  To migrate: update any `defaultColumnLayout={{ pinned: { x: "left" } }}` to
  `"start"` (and `"right"` → `"end"`), any persisted `colPin` URLs, and any custom
  `labels` overriding the renamed keys.

- a90a2c2: Numbered page buttons in every adapter's pagination (with first/last and
  ellipsis truncation), replacing the prev/next-only control — driven by a shared
  `paginationItems` builder in `@adapttable/core`.

### Patch Changes

- 07db665: Accessibility: give the filter overlay an accessible name — the Chakra and
  Radix filter popovers and the MUI filter drawer now set `aria-label` on their
  `role="dialog"` wrapper, fixing an `aria-dialog-name` violation. Locked in with
  axe assertions across every adapter's filter overlay (popover + drawer).

## 0.2.2

### Patch Changes

- 0fe5eca: Ship the **React Compiler**. The published packages are now built with `babel-plugin-react-compiler` (target 18, **production build only** — not the test build), so components and hooks are auto-memoized for fewer wasted re-renders. Tests still run against un-compiled source, so coverage is unaffected; the compiled output adds `react-compiler-runtime` as a small runtime dependency.
- Updated dependencies [0fe5eca]
  - @adapttable/core@0.2.2

## 0.2.1

### Patch Changes

- dd60cf0: docs: each package readme now links the docs site, live demo, and getting-started guide (top links + a Documentation section deep-linking each feature), the `homepage` field points at the docs site, and the root readme gains npm badges. Tailwind/shadcn is reframed as the unstyled adapter path rather than a batteries-included styled adapter.
- Updated dependencies [dd60cf0]
  - @adapttable/core@0.2.1

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 83610ec: Support React 19 and the latest major of every UI kit.

  - **core / unstyled**: hook and chrome ref types follow React 19's
    `useRef<T>(null) → RefObject<T | null>` change, and the deprecated
    `MutableRefObject` is replaced with `RefObject`. The prop-getters
    (`getTableProps`, `getHeaderCellProps`, `getSortButtonProps`,
    `getCellProps`, `getSearchInputProps`) now return precise element-prop
    interfaces instead of a bare `Record<string, unknown>`, so adapters spread
    them without unsafe casts. React peer stays `^18 || ^19`.
  - **mantine**: adds `@mantine/core` / `@mantine/hooks` `^9` to the peer range
    (now `^7 || ^8 || ^9`); Mantine 9 requires React 19.
  - **mui**: adds `@mui/material` `^8 || ^9` to the peer range. System props
    that v7 removed from `Stack` / `Box` / `Typography` (`alignItems`, `py`,
    `fontWeight`, …) moved into `sx`, which is backward-compatible to v5.
  - **chakra**: rebuilt for Chakra UI **v3** — compound components
    (`Table.Root`, `Menu.Root`, `Popover.Root`, `Drawer.Root`, …),
    `ChakraProvider value={defaultSystem}`, and the v3 prop renames
    (`colorScheme → colorPalette`, `isOpen → open`, …). Peer is now
    `@chakra-ui/react@^3`; Chakra v2 is no longer supported.
  - **antd**: rebuilt for Ant Design **v6** — `Alert` `message → title`,
    `Drawer` `width → size`, `Popover` `styles.body → styles.content`, `Space`
    `direction → orientation`, `Tag` `bordered={false} → variant="filled"`, and
    the logical fixed-column class names. Peer is now `antd@^6`; Ant Design v5 is
    no longer supported.

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 845ff41: Initial public release of AdaptTable — a headless, UI-agnostic React data
  table: one API, rendered natively by your design system.
  - `@adapttable/core`: the headless engine — declarative `columns` (bare
    keys, dot-paths, auto headers) and `filters` (one definition drives the
    widget, URL params, chips, and predicate, with `"auto"` and async option
    sources), three data tiers (in-memory, server via one consolidated
    `onQueryChange(query, { signal })`, or a full custom `TableSource`),
    URL-synced state with an injectable adapter (`urlSync={false}` for
    in-memory), multi-sort, summary rows, header groups, row expansion,
    saved views, select-all-N-matching, keyboard row navigation, and opt-in
    row/card virtualization that tracks the page or any `maxHeight` scroll
    box — 50,000 rows stay a handful of DOM nodes.
  - Batteries-included adapters for **Mantine**, **MUI**, **Chakra UI**,
    **Ant Design**, and **Tailwind/shadcn** (`@adapttable/unstyled`): native
    filter forms with operator-first number/date ranges, column management
    (hide / reorder / pin / resize — the row-actions column included), a
    built-in saved-views menu, mobile card layouts, and memoized rows.
  - `@adapttable/i18n`: label presets for ten locales (en, ar, de, es, fr,
    he, it, ja, pt, zh) with RTL helpers — headers, cells, sorting and
    filtering can all follow per-locale data paths.
  - `@adapttable/cli`: `npx @adapttable/cli init` detects your kit and
    scaffolds a working table.

  Highlights: shareable URL state, paging and true infinite scroll (auto by
  device), first-class RTL, seamless dark mode, 100% test coverage, and a
  full headless escape hatch at every layer.
