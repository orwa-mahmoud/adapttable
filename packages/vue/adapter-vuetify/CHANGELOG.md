# @adapttable/vuetify

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 1946b61: Add Vue column management, header rename, command palettes, context menus,
  Saved Views and controlled side panels across all eight native kits. URL and
  browser-storage layout persistence support reactive destinations and SSR-safe
  hydration; saving or applying a view flushes pending layout and Find state.
  
  Menus preserve native keyboard/typeahead navigation, labels and nested Escape
  handling. Stable anchors and accepted focus survive ordinary rerenders; retired
  callbacks, superseded destinations and disposed owners reject late work. Side
  panels keep valid tab/body associations for opaque and Unicode keys.
- a06027e: Add focused Vue kit factories for grid navigation, Find, range and column
  selection, virtualization, row pinning/reordering, grouping, trees, row details,
  nested tables, summaries, footer renderers, pivoting, formulas, streams and
  sparklines. All eight adapters supply native controls through the shared Vue
  models, including dedicated grouping, movement, status and selection panels.
  
  Preserve controlled updates, authoritative row identity, mobile layouts and
  pinned-column geometry. Release removed row measurements, invalidate delayed
  moves and focus requests when their owner changes, and report grouping/stream
  updates through the current callback. Existing column-selection and nested-table
  aliases remain available alongside the canonical feature paths.
- 7ba801b: Add opt-in filtering, compact header filters, removable filter chips, cell and
  row editing, batch editing and edit history to the Vue binding and all eight
  native kits. Host-owned writes keep drafts, saving state and errors attached to
  the active edit session. Native editors preserve generic row/column inference.
  
  Filter drawers and popovers keep native dismissal, nested Select Escape handling,
  input labels and focus restoration. Retained controls stop acting after their
  field, feature, component or KeepAlive activity is replaced or retired.
- 78f6e38: Add Vue kit standard-feature presets, bulk actions, print and export factories.
  The canonical export entry retains the CSV alias; focused PDF and XLSX entries
  keep format writers out of plain-table, CSV and preset bundles.
  
  Exports follow the active source and ignore late outcomes after replacement or
  retirement. Native bulk confirmations cannot write through a retired owner.
  All data changes remain host-controlled.
- dedb4b1: Introduce the experimental Vue binding and eight native adapters: Unstyled,
  Element Plus, Naive UI, Nuxt UI, Quasar, Reka UI, shadcn-vue and Vuetify.
  Tables support controlled selection, sorting, search, pagination, responsive
  cards, column layout, loading states and host-rendered header actions. Each kit
  renders its own controls and exposes the shared semantic parts and class hooks.
  
  Include localized, keyboard-accessible density choices, RTL layouts, SSR-safe
  controls and native fullscreen ownership. Keep labels on native inputs, table
  headers aligned with selection controls, and checkbox/button colors readable
  without a host CSS reset. The packages require Vue 3.5.0 or newer; Nuxt UI
  requires Vue 3.5.18 or newer. The first release is 0.1.0.
- 2153f11: Add optional Vue agents, conversations and speech input with native assistant
  and approval surfaces in every kit. The binding adapts neutral execution stores,
  host-confirmed controlled updates, KeepAlive suspension and disposal; dedicated
  assistant UI entries remain free of AI runtime dependencies.
  
  Approval widgets can open a full review with Back/Escape focus return and
  controlled expansion. Reviews follow the approval's identity across snapshots;
  receipts expose scoped action/turn undo, blocked explanations, speaker/question
  structure and a dedicated live region. Examples are keyboard-accessible native
  menus. Retained actions retire with their displayed message or conversation.
