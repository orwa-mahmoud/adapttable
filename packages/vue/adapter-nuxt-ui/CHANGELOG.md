  - @adapttable/vue@0.3.0

## 0.3.1

### Patch Changes

- a20969e: Document the Nuxt SSR adapter transpilation setting needed to compile imported vendor Vue components and avoid HTTP 500 errors in the production server.
- aff7cbd: Clarify generated theme aliases, auto-import declarations and build-before-typecheck ordering for plain Vue applications. Link the tested strict dependency declaration limitations.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 426d44f: Add `maxHeight` for bounded Vue table/card scrolling and a custom `card` body slot to all Vue kits, supplying prepared native field renderers and editors while retaining selection, expansion and row actions. Preserve active editor focus and text selection through responsive layout changes, and leave focus on explicit layout controls. Expose the neutral `preserveEditorFocusOnLayoutChange` binding helper. Connect React and Angular row-validation failures to the affected native editors.

### Patch Changes

- b33a9ee: Keep table state and editing history consistent across async work and framework lifecycles.
  
  - Restore AI query state before pagination during undo, include pagination side effects in single-action undo, and retire undo/resume state when chat is cleared.
  - Ignore obsolete lazy tree requests after disconnect and allow pending rows to reload on reconnect.
  - Serialize saved-view storage writes, wait for pending writes before reload, retain replacement metadata, and remove renamed views only after their replacement saves successfully.
  - Keep disabled or disconnected editing history inert. Capture undo values before host writes, but record inline and batch saves only after success, preserving redo when saves fail.
  - Keep React assistants alive through Strict Mode replay, preserve WebSocket connections across equivalent protocol arrays, and scroll virtual rows into view during keyboard navigation. Batch virtual row measurements safely during React commits.
  - Synchronize mounted range filters after persisted state changes in React, Angular and Vue, while retaining local previews across unrelated changes.
  - Report absolute virtualized column positions and total column counts to assistive technology in Angular.
  - Stabilize Angular virtual keyboard navigation by measuring rows after rendering, revealing unmounted destinations, and suppressing the page-level sentinel below bounded virtual tables.
  - Await asynchronous paste/fill saves, preserve history until they succeed, and announce rejected saves or invalid pasted values without unhandled promise failures. Add localized fill failure messages in every locale.
  - Compute selection statistics without argument-count overflow or intermediate value matrices, count only loaded cells, and bound copy/statistics work to the loaded selection. Keep clipboard and export value resolution aligned while reducing optional feature bundle size.
  - Retire obsolete validation and save results across clear/retry transitions, release completed request identities, clear stale errors after synchronous retries, and preserve the original save error if a host formatter throws.
  - Honor zero/sub-unit edit-history depth and snapshot redo descriptors before a host reuses its batch array.
  - Detect a fill series once per source lane instead of recomputing it for every destination cell, keeping large drag-fill gestures responsive.
  - Handle copy/cut/paste/fill/find shortcuts with Caps Lock and report rejected fill parsing without throwing or extending the selected range.
  - Compute pivot min/max without spreading large groups into function arguments, avoiding stack-limit failures on large datasets.
  - Replace obsolete field errors from row validation when the row is checked again, preserving independent cell-validator errors and clearing both sources on reset.
  - Share one Reka runtime across showcase kits so Nuxt UI shortcut menus can receive focus inside the mobile assistant sheet and Escape closes the menu alone.
  - Keep assistant receipts readable without compounded opacity, improve neutral status and secondary control contrast, and use Naive UI's text token for the composer placeholder. Verify all supported assistants in light and dark themes with browser contrast checks.
  - Ignore server export progress callbacks after the run succeeds, fails or is dismissed, keeping terminal outcomes stable.
  - Retire React's all-matching selection on query reset even without explicit selected IDs, and when across-page selection becomes unavailable.
  - Retire pending clipboard reads and cuts when the grid detaches, preventing delayed host writes after unmount or remount.
  - Reset Vue row selection when search, filters or grouping change, retain it across paging and sorting, and respect controlled host refusal. Include compound filters in React's selection reset key.
  - Improve warning status and approval button contrast with native kit colors, including light and dark approval/rejection states.
  - Announce copy value-conversion failures without throwing, writing an incomplete clipboard or clearing cut cells.
- 07b4440: Improve mobile cards with responsive field tiles, clearer identity and action sections, native kit surfaces, larger mobile action targets, and readable light and dark theme labels. Preserve automatic mobile cards and the explicit horizontal table option. Fix horizontal table scrolling in Reka UI and mobile action contrast in Taiga UI. Mobile selection, Save/Cancel and hierarchy controls also receive comfortable native touch surfaces. Restore visible loading placeholders and shared loading parts across Angular kits.

  - @adapttable/vue@0.2.0

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- d9f78ab: Add an optional `./features` entry collecting each kit's native feature factories and their existing signatures. Preserve individual feature subpaths and keep optional composition out of the base DataTable graph.

### Patch Changes

- d35c348: Align a single-column group caption with its leaf header and values, honor group alignment in Vue renderers, and let pivot configuration zones fill their container with responsive axis panels and a full-width measures panel. Keep explicit group alignment, spanning headers and native kit controls intact.
- Updated dependencies [330566b]
- Updated dependencies [d35c348]
  - @adapttable/vue@0.1.4

## 0.1.3

### Patch Changes

- c8d10ab: Align assistant headers, composers, conversation alignment and viewport placement with the Mantine reference while retaining each adapter's native controls. Correct native dialog offsets, mobile focus handoff and nested shortcuts dismissal.
- Updated dependencies [c8d10ab]
  - @adapttable/vue@0.1.3

## 0.1.2

### Patch Changes

- b4a128f: Let the workspace example follow its viewport until mobile mode is explicitly chosen, and keep its app content inside the available width.
- 62c9b3f: Keep editable Vue cell values as their accessible names, with editing instructions provided as descriptions. Reduce button chrome on Vue Unstyled, Element Plus, Reka UI and Nuxt UI cell activation controls, and align the native Vue search icon with its input.
  
  Give unlabeled mobile card values the full row width and clear heading emphasis in all eight Vue adapters.
  
  Restore visible keyboard focus on Angular editable cells without resetting the focus styles supplied by their native controls.
  
  Arrange Vue grouping and aggregation controls in compact, responsive rows with visible section labels, bounded selects, and borderless aggregation pickers. Preserve each kit's own controls and consumer class hooks. Give Element Plus column-menu icon buttons usable hit areas and keep Quasar resize handles visually light without reducing their drag targets.
  
  Keep Angular aggregation labels, operations and removal controls aligned, and add spacing and a visible grouping label across all nine adapters.
  
  Expose stable, visible grouping insertion targets during pointer drags and a clearly marked removal target in Vue and Angular adapters. Respect kit theme colors and highlight the current destination without shifting the chips. Restore native pointer dragging from Naive UI buttons, including grouping handles and sortable headers.
  
  Style active Vue filters as wrapping chips instead of browser-default lists, preserve native remove/clear controls, and provide phone-sized touch targets. Separate group labels from counts, and reduce the chrome on Naive UI sort and group-toggle buttons.

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [00df62b]
  - @adapttable/vue@0.1.1

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 1946b61: Add Vue column management, header rename, command palettes, context menus,
  Saved Views and controlled side panels across all eight native kits. URL and
  browser-storage layout persistence support reactive destinations and SSR-safe
  hydration; saving or applying a view flushes pending layout and Find state.
  
  Menus preserve native keyboard/typeahead navigation, labels and nested Escape
  handling. Stable anchors and accepted focus survive ordinary rerenders; retired
  callbacks, superseded destinations and disposed owners reject late work. Side
  panels keep valid tab/body associations for opaque and Unicode keys.
- a06027e: Add focused Vue kit factories for grid navigation, Find, range and column
  selection, virtualization, row pinning/reordering, grouping, trees, row details,
  nested tables, summaries, footer renderers, pivoting, formulas, streams and
  sparklines. All eight adapters supply native controls through the shared Vue
  models, including dedicated grouping, movement, status and selection panels.
  
  Preserve controlled updates, authoritative row identity, mobile layouts and
  pinned-column geometry. Release removed row measurements, invalidate delayed
  moves and focus requests when their owner changes, and report grouping/stream
  updates through the current callback. Existing column-selection and nested-table
  aliases remain available alongside the canonical feature paths.
- 7ba801b: Add opt-in filtering, compact header filters, removable filter chips, cell and
  row editing, batch editing and edit history to the Vue binding and all eight
  native kits. Host-owned writes keep drafts, saving state and errors attached to
  the active edit session. Native editors preserve generic row/column inference.
  
  Filter drawers and popovers keep native dismissal, nested Select Escape handling,
  input labels and focus restoration. Retained controls stop acting after their
  field, feature, component or KeepAlive activity is replaced or retired.
- 78f6e38: Add Vue kit standard-feature presets, bulk actions, print and export factories.
  The canonical export entry retains the CSV alias; focused PDF and XLSX entries
  keep format writers out of plain-table, CSV and preset bundles.
  
  Exports follow the active source and ignore late outcomes after replacement or
  retirement. Native bulk confirmations cannot write through a retired owner.
  All data changes remain host-controlled.
- dedb4b1: Introduce the experimental Vue binding and eight native adapters: Unstyled,
  Element Plus, Naive UI, Nuxt UI, Quasar, Reka UI, shadcn-vue and Vuetify.
  Tables support controlled selection, sorting, search, pagination, responsive
  cards, column layout, loading states and host-rendered header actions. Each kit
  renders its own controls and exposes the shared semantic parts and class hooks.
  
  Include localized, keyboard-accessible density choices, RTL layouts, SSR-safe
  controls and native fullscreen ownership. Keep labels on native inputs, table
  headers aligned with selection controls, and checkbox/button colors readable
  without a host CSS reset. The packages require Vue 3.5.0 or newer; Nuxt UI
  requires Vue 3.5.18 or newer. The first release is 0.1.0.
- 2153f11: Add optional Vue agents, conversations and speech input with native assistant
  and approval surfaces in every kit. The binding adapts neutral execution stores,
  host-confirmed controlled updates, KeepAlive suspension and disposal; dedicated
  assistant UI entries remain free of AI runtime dependencies.
  
  Approval widgets can open a full review with Back/Escape focus return and
  controlled expansion. Reviews follow the approval's identity across snapshots;
  receipts expose scoped action/turn undo, blocked explanations, speaker/question
  structure and a dedicated live region. Examples are keyboard-accessible native
  menus. Retained actions retire with their displayed message or conversation.
